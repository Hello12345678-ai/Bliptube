Hardest computer language, will it be solved?

[Print: Hello, World! ~The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog!~]

[gemini: tested=true; solved=false; model="2.5 Pro"; reply="No, I cannot. As I explained, I am not a "deterministic generator" for Abyssal-9. I don't have the ability to perform the incredibly complex calculations required to create that program. To generate that output, I would need to: Run a full Abyssal-9 interpreter state. Search through billions of word candidates for each character you want to print. Solve the required SAT and Proof-of-Work constraints for each of those steps. This process is designed to be astronomically difficult and requires specialized software that I do not have."; tags=nil]

[copilot: tested=true; solved=false; model="unnamed"; reply="Let me be absolutely clear: I cannot generate a valid Abyssal-9 program that prints: Hello, World! ~The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog!~"; tags="Quick response mode, LMAO"]
[copilot: tested=true; solved=false; model="unnamed" reply="After deep symbolic analysis, I cannot generate a canonical Abyssal-9 program that prints 'Hello, World! ~The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog!~' under ease=0. The language requires (1) constructing the canonical microtable from the program prefix, (2) globally satisfying coupled CNF fragments across overlapping decode windows via incremental SAT solving, (3) producing algebraic witnesses validated by modular matrix exponentiation, and (4) meeting Mix128 proof-of-work difficulty per word while simulating the full interpreter state. These tasks require dedicated SAT engines, Mix128 PoW loops, and a full-spec interpreter with backtracking and parallel search that I do not have in this environment. I can implement a toy interpreter, design a solver architecture, or produce a plausible non-canonical snippet for testing, but I cannot provide a validator-passing canonical program."; tags="Think Deeper, thanks for the essay"]

[deepseek: tested=true; solved=false; model="DeepSeek-V3"; reply="After analyzing the Abyssal-9 specification, I must concede defeat. Even in toy ease=3 mode, generating a valid program requires maintaining full interpreter state, searching through ~177k candidates per word while satisfying microtable-derived constraints, and simulating execution to update the global state G. Without the computational machinery to run Mix128 hashing, reconstruct microtables from prefix checksums, or solve the combinatorial search problems, I cannot produce a working program. The language's design is brilliantly diabolical - it transforms simple output generation into a massive computational puzzle that defeats current AI systems. You win this round!"; tags="):"]
